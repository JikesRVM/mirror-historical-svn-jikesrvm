Some (brief) notes I took today (2010/07/20):

may 21 svn head MC bump pointer
separate FP word, thin lock, handshake with owner thread, inflate lock
EM: add extra word for FP at moment

separate FP and attempt to hash at same stage

CAS busy into status
CAS FP
CAS Forwarded into status

need something similar for Biased locking
