<HEAD><TITLE>Jikes RVM Userguide</TITLE>

<BODY>
The <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/RVM/User+Guide">online
version of the Jikes RVM userguide</a> tracks the svn head of the
project.<p>

For releases of Jikes RVM, we export this userguide as a <a
href ="userguide.pdf">pdf file</a> and as <a
href="html/RVM/index.html">standalone html</a>.

Unfortunately, at the time of the 2.9.1 release, confluence exports on 
Codehaus were not working.  Therefore, there is no exported user guide
included in the 2.9.1 release.  We direct you to either the 2.9.0 release,
which did include an exported userguide, or the the online version.
