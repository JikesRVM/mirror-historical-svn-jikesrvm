* Progress
  + 1.5 months (07/14/08 ~ 08/26/08)
  + Achievements
    + Method call in the expression evaluation: working 
    + Single stepping: working
    + Source code refactoring: performed
      + Most of the JikesRVM specific implementation is in org.jikesrvm.debug package
      + org.jikesrvm.debug is self-contained, and is not dependent on gnu.classpath.jdwp
  + Achievement compared with the proposal [SOC_PROPOSAL.JDWP.txt] and
    the midterm progress [MIDTERM-eval.JDWP.txt]
    + All the proposed features were implemented.
    + Extensive testing and overhead evaluation were not
      performed. These work will be better served through the user
      feed back.

* TODO work (after the Google SOC period)
  + Preparing for getting into the JikesRVM trunk.
    + Add more comments to the source code.
    + More source code refactoring for maintaince.
    + Throw out unnecessory code.
  + Getting into the trunk
    + Generate and send the JDWP patches (JikesRVM + GNUClasspath).

  + More feed-back from community
    + Perform regression test and fix any bugs.
